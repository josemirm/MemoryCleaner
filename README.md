# Josemi's Memory Cleaner
## About this:
This software have an easy way to free memory in Windows systems.

It works allocating all non-used memory in the system to occupy all "pending" memory, after that it frees all the allocated memory to let it completely free, not "half-free, half-pending-to-free" as Windows usually handle it.

The last version of the program check your physical free memory on your computer to do the cleaning automatically without any stability issue.

## UPDATE 1
* Some bugs found in the code are solved.
* Changed the default percentage of used memory from 90% to 80% to resolve stability issues.
* Changes in the arguments. Now you set a percentage to clean instead a fixed value of kilobytes.
* Added a check to 32-bit version users to advise them to use the 64-bit version when there are more than 2 GB of RAM to clean.
* Refactored the code and the "Read Me" file.

## Using the software:
There are compiled binaries to use Windows machines in addition to the single C source file. If you have less than 4 GB of RAM you could use both, but if you use the 32-bit version in a 64-bit machine it will not work properly.

Here are binaries and code downloads:

* Download source code: [MemCleaner.c](https://github.com/josemirm/MemoryCleaner/raw/master/MemCleaner.c)
* Download 64-bit binary (Recommended): [MemCleaner64.exe](https://github.com/josemirm/MemoryCleaner/releases/download/v1.1/MemCleaner64.exe)
* Download 32-bit binary: [MemCleaner32.exe](https://github.com/josemirm/MemoryCleaner/releases/download/v1.1/MemCleaner32.exe)

Do not use the versions in the "OldVersions" folder: It will try to get all your system memory and make it unstable. Use it at your own risk.

## What happens on non-Windows machines:
This program is completely targeted to Windows machines, in other OS the memory management works different and have diffent problems and solutions. Also, it uses non-portable Windows functions unavailable in other OS.
